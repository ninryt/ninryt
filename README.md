## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Nina B.**, and I am a trained Data Scientist and Researcher from the University of Economics in Poland (Szczecin). 
I am passionate about combining data analysis using SQL, Python and analytical tools with User Research to leverage digital and non-digital products.

:seedling: **Iâ€™m currently developing an AI-powered web-scraping model** using Python and machine learning
to automate data extraction and analysis.

:hammer_and_wrench: **I recently designed and developed**:  
- **A comprehensive SQL database and program** that automatically scrapes personalized, most suitable job offers. check it out [here](https://github.com/ninryt/python-sql-web_jobscraper)
- **A Python project** that automates sending personalized emails via Gmail and Excel and migrates data to SQL database, check it out [here](https://github.com/ninryt/automated-email-sender).

:books: **I am committed to continuous growth** â€” check out my latest professional recertification  â€” [here](./recertification.md).

:handshake: **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate** on exciting **SQL, Python, or UX Research** projects to build innovative solutions.
