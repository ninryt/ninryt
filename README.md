## Hi there 👋 

My name is Nina B., and I am a trained Data Scientist and Researcher from the University of Economics in Poland, Szczecin. 
I am passionate about combining data analysis using SQL, Python and analytical tools with User Research to leverage digital and non-digital products.

- 🔸 I’m currently developing an AI-powered web-scraping model to automate data extraction and analysis
- 🔸 I recently designed and developed:
  - a comprehensive SQL database and program that automatically scrapes personalized, most suitable job offers on the market, check it out [here](https://github.com/ninryt/python-sql-web_jobscraper)
  - a Python project automates the process of sending personalized emails to customers using Gmail and an Excel, check it out [here](https://github.com/ninryt/automated-email-sender).
- 🔸 I am committed to continuous growth — check out my latest professional recertification [here](./recertification.md).
- 🔸 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting SQL, Python or UX Research projects to build innovative solutions.
